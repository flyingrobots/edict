# SPEC - Edict Target Profile ABI v1

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

## Purpose

This specification defines the runtime target profile ABI used by Edict Core
lowering. Edict Language v1 owns source syntax and Core IR. A target profile owns
runtime intrinsics, target IR, footprint algebra, cost algebra, obstruction
taxonomy, application semantics, lowering, and verification.

A prose ABI is not yet an ABI. It becomes an ABI when two independent
implementations can exchange bytes and agree. This specification is therefore
split into three layers, and **all three are normative**:

1. The canonical manifest schema, defined once in
   [`abi/edict-target-profile.cddl`](./abi/edict-target-profile.cddl).
2. The executable plugin boundary, defined once in
   [`abi/edict-target-provider.wit`](./abi/edict-target-provider.wit).
3. The exchange types and doctrine in this document.

Every JSON block below is **generated from the CDDL schema and is illustrative
only**. The schema is the single source of truth; duplicate normative JSON is
forbidden (`EDICT-ABI-NODUP-001`).

## Profile Manifest

A target profile manifest is hash-significant data conforming to
[`abi/edict-target-profile.cddl`](./abi/edict-target-profile.cddl). It references
each normative subcomponent by identity plus digest (`resource-ref`). It must not
embed its own self-digest in its preimage (`EDICT-CORE-SELFHASH-001`). The
illustrative shape:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "edict.target-profile/v1",
  "id": "echo.dpo",
  "version": "1",
  "acceptedCoreAbi": ["edict.core/v1"],
  "intrinsicNamespace": "echo.dpo@1",
  "intrinsics": { "id": "echo.dpo.intrinsics/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "operationProfiles": {
    "id": "echo.dpo.operation-profiles/v1", "digest": "sha256:..."
  },
  "footprintAlgebra": { "id": "echo.dpo.footprint/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "costAlgebra": { "id": "echo.dpo.cost/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "targetIr": { "id": "echo.span-ir/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "obstructionTaxonomy": {
    "id": "echo.dpo.obstructions/v1", "digest": "sha256:..."
  },
  "verifier": { "id": "echo.dpo.verifier/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "lowerer": { "id": "echo.dpo.lowerer/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "sandbox": { "id": "edict.wasm-component/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "fuelModel": { "id": "edict.fuel/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },

  "bundleProfile": { "id": "echo.dpo.bundle/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },
  "generatedArtifactProfiles": [
    { "id": "echo.dpo.registration/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." }
  ],
  "canonicalEncodingRules": {
    "id": "edict.canonical-cbor/v1", "digest": "sha256:..."
  },
  "acceptedLawpackAdapterAbi": [],
  "diagnosticAbi": { "id": "edict.diagnostics/v1", "digest": "sha256:..." },

  "applicationModel": "atomic",
  "readConsistency": "application-snapshot",
  "guardEvaluation": "precommit-atomic",
  "obstructionRollback": "no-visible-effects",
  "multiTarget": false,
  "postconditionSupport": true,
  "deterministicExecution": {
    "id": "edict.determinism/v1", "digest": "sha256:..."
  },
  "conformanceFixtureCorpus": {
    "id": "echo.dpo.fixtures/v1", "digest": "sha256:..."
  }
}
```

The manifest carries every field the Language spec requires of a profile,
including `bundleProfile`, `generatedArtifactProfiles`, `canonicalEncodingRules`,
and `diagnosticAbi`. This is the **single** authoritative manifest; the Language
spec must not duplicate it (`EDICT-ABI-NODUP-001`).

`acceptedLawpackAdapterAbi` is **reserved and deferred**: it will list accepted
lawpack-adapter ABI ids once the byte-level `edict.lawpack-adapter/v1` ABI is
specified. Until that schema exists it is optional and empty, and a target must
not be expected to validate adapter compatibility from it
(`EDICT-ABI-LAWPACK-ADAPTER-DEFER-001`). Lawpack adapters are still digest-locked
resource references in the lawpack manifest; only the cross-ABI compatibility
field is deferred.

Display metadata is not part of this manifest. Human-facing names, codenames,
and marketing copy live in sidecar documents keyed by the target profile digest.

The reference `edict_syntax` conformance surface accepts typed manifest values
only. It validates the profile API version, identity, accepted Core ABI,
digest-locked component references, canonical encoding rule, deferred
lawpack-adapter ABI emptiness, and v1 application doctrine. The checker is
runtime-neutral: Echo and non-Echo profile shapes are accepted or rejected by the
same obligations.

## Exchange Types And Plugin Boundary

The component boundary is defined in
[`abi/edict-target-provider.wit`](./abi/edict-target-provider.wit). It pins the
byte-level exchange so independent lowerers, verifiers, and hosts can
interoperate:

```text
protocol version + digest-bound Core + target profile + semantic inputs
  + requested output roles + deterministic response limits
                                --> lowerer.lower
                                --> declared artifact bytes | typed refusal

protocol version + digest-bound Core + target profile + Target IR
  + semantic inputs
  + requested verifier output roles + deterministic response limits
                                --> verifier.verify
                                --> verifier artifact bytes | typed refusal
```

Each input crossing the boundary is opaque `{ domain, bytes }` paired with a
digest-locked resource reference verified by the host. The WIT transport does
not duplicate the artifact's owning schema. Lowerer output kinds are
structurally distinct from verifier output kinds, so a lowerer cannot claim a
verifier report and a verifier cannot claim Target IR or generated artifacts.
Output artifacts declare a role and domain plus an optional logical path, but
carry no digest: the host validates canonicality and the path, then computes
authoritative identity. Diagnostics are structured (`code`, typed `severity`,
`message`, optional `repair`) and remain non-hash sidecars. The verifier is
evidence, not authority: it never mutates runtime state and never overrides
participant admission (I-014).

Roles in role-keyed lists are non-empty and unique, and each list is sorted by
ascending UTF-8 role bytes. Every success output matches one requested
`(role, kind, domain)`, every request is satisfied exactly once, and present
logical paths are unique by exact case-sensitive UTF-8 bytes. Diagnostics use
the exact lexicographic order declared in WIT. The response byte limit is an
aggregate checked sum over all provider-authored byte lists and UTF-8 strings
in either success or refusal.
Exceeding a count or byte limit, or overflowing the sum, is a host-owned
response failure. Limits cannot change the canonical result; if it fits two
limit sets, the entire result arm is byte-identical.

The `edict:target-provider@1.0.0` package supersedes the earlier unhosted
`edict:target-profile@1.0.0` WIT direction. A distinct package identity is
required because the explicit request/result envelope is not wire-compatible
with the old opaque two-argument context and single-artifact outcome.

The lowerer compares cost and footprint against the operation's **declared**
target ceiling only. It never receives a participant-admitted budget; admission
is external by design, so target IR and verifier artifacts stay
participant-neutral bundle inputs (`EDICT-TARGET-NEUTRAL-LOWERING-001`).

## Lowering Requirements

`lowering-requirements` is the typed pre-lowering question for v1 lowerability.
Its canonical shape is defined in
[`abi/edict-target-profile.cddl`](./abi/edict-target-profile.cddl) and is encoded
as `edict.lowering-requirements/v1`.

The artifact records the required operation profile, semantic effects, write
classes, guard kinds, atomicity, postcondition support, obstruction
coordinates, footprint obligations, cost obligations, and optic contract. Watson
or an agent may propose this artifact from prose, but the compiler checks the
artifact, not the prose.

The v1 lowerability checker classifies support as:

- `native`: explicit target-profile facts directly support every obligation;
- `adapted`: every non-native semantic effect is discharged by exactly one
  direct lawpack adapter for the selected target profile;
- `unsupported`: at least one obligation is missing, ambiguous, or requires an
  adapter chain/composite discharge.

Native and adapted support must satisfy the semantic effect's required guard
kinds at the selected effect/intrinsic support fact; global profile support for a
guard kind is not enough by itself.

The checker does not produce Target IR and does not perform admission.

## Application Model

A lawful-autonomous v1 operation lowers to one target-owned atomic application
unit.

Target profiles must declare:

- read consistency model;
- precommit guard evaluation model;
- `postconditionSupport`: whether precommit postcondition (`guarantee`) checks
  can be evaluated inside the atomic application unit;
- obstruction rollback behavior;
- visibility rules for successful writes;
- resource failure behavior;
- whether the profile is single-target or a composite target profile.

A precommit `guarantee` lowers only to a profile whose `postconditionSupport` is
true. If an operation requires a precommit postcondition and the selected target
profile does not support it, lowering fails with an unsupported-lowering
compiler error (`EDICT-TARGET-POSTCOND-001`); it is never silently dropped or
downgraded to a non-atomic check.

The v1 default application model is:

```json
{
  "applicationModel": "atomic",
  "readConsistency": "application-snapshot",
  "guardEvaluation": "precommit-atomic",
  "obstructionRollback": "no-visible-effects",
  "multiTarget": false
}
```

All runtime reads observe one target-defined application snapshot. Mutable
requirements are checked in the same application unit. Writes become visible
atomically. Any obstruction, resource failure, or failed guarantee leaves
externally visible target state unchanged.

## Runtime Effect Domain

An Edict action may lower to effects owned by at most one runtime target profile.
Lawpack semantic effects may lower into that same target. Cross-target
application requires a composite target profile that explicitly owns
coordination, obstruction classification, and atomicity semantics.

## Intrinsic Signatures

Each target intrinsic declares an `intrinsicClass` of `pure` or `effect`. Pure
symbolic constructors (`echo.ref<T>(id)`, `echo.edge<...>(...)`, id constructors,
plan constructors) are `pure`: they produce inert, canonical, hashable plan
terms and carry no effect kind. Only an `effect` intrinsic carries an effect
kind and failure classes (`EDICT-TARGET-INTRINSIC-CLASS-001`).

Each target intrinsic must declare:

- canonical coordinate;
- `intrinsicClass`: `pure` or `effect`;
- type parameters;
- argument types;
- return type;
- guard support;
- footprint template;
- cost template;
- `writeClass`: `read`, `create`, `ensure`, `append`, `replace`, `delete`,
  `none` (for pure constructors), or `custom`.

An `effect` intrinsic additionally declares:

- effect kind;
- `effectFailures`: the **named, typed** low-level failures it can raise. Each
  has a `coordinate` (e.g. `mismatch`, `boundExceeded`), an `authorityClass`
  (`domainMappable`/`participantOwned`/...), and a bounded `payloadType`
  (`EDICT-ABI-FAILURE-NAMED-001`);
- whether the effect can participate in a target-atomic guard.

Broad authority classes alone are insufficient: a source obstruction arm
`mismatch(fault) => Domain.X(...)` binds the named failure `mismatch` declared
here and constructs its typed domain obstruction from `fault`'s payload. An arm
naming a failure the effect does not declare is a compile error.

A `pure` intrinsic must declare `effectKind` absent and `writeClass: none`. A
pure constructor that reaches runtime state is a relapse and rejects.

## Operation Mode Predicates

This section is the **authoritative** definition of the operation-mode
predicates (`EDICT-OPMODE-AUTHORITY-001`); the language spec's Profile Vocabulary
mirrors it for convenience only.

Operation mode is a verifier predicate over inferred effects:

- `readOnly`: effects that are **either** proof-only semantic facts **or** have
  authoritative `writeClass` `read` (including runtime semantic reads); no
  mutating `writeClass`.
- `createOnly`: read, create, and ensure effects; no replace, delete, append, or
  runtime-materialized semantic writes except effects explicitly classified as
  create by the resolved target profile.
- `append`: read and append effects; no replace or delete.
- `replace`: read, create, ensure, and replace effects as profile-defined; no
  delete unless the profile explicitly classifies the operation mode as custom.
- `custom`: target-profile-defined predicate with a digest-locked verifier rule.

`ensure` counts as a profile-declared effect. A target profile must state whether
it behaves as read plus conditional create, create-if-absent plus equality guard,
or a more restrictive target-native primitive.

## Obstruction Taxonomy

Each effect declares **named** low-level failures (`effectFailures`), and each
named failure carries an `authorityClass`. The authority class governs whether
source may map the failure:

- `domainMappable`: may be mapped by source to a typed domain obstruction.
- `participantOwned`: remains a participant or admission obstruction.
- `integrityFault`: remains an integrity failure.
- `resourceFault`: remains a resource or budget obstruction.
- `internalFault`: remains a platform/internal failure.

The obstruction map is keyed by **failure coordinate**, not by authority class,
so two `domainMappable` failures on the same effect (e.g. `mismatch` and
`boundExceeded`) are distinct, separately-mapped arms. An effect's
`effectFailures` coordinates must be **unique**; a repeated coordinate makes
exhaustive mapping and binder typing ambiguous and is rejected
(`EDICT-ABI-FAILURE-UNIQUE-001`).

Source `else` mappings may translate only profile-declared `domainMappable`
classes. Authors must not translate permission failure, signature failure,
verifier defects, participant policy rejection, or internal target failure into a
domain obstruction.

Obstructions must have typed payload schemas. For example, stale-basis
obstructions should be able to carry expected and observed basis values when the
target profile supports them.

## Guard Semantics

Target guards are attached to effect nodes or target application units:

```json
{
  "predicate": {
    "op": "==",
    "left": { "field": "current.canonicalHeadId" },
    "right": { "local": "%baseHead.headId" }
  },
  "enforcement": "targetAtomic",
  "obstruction": {
    "coordinate": "jedit.rope@1.StaleBaseHead",
    "failureBinder": null,
    "payload": {
      "expected": { "local": "%baseHead.headId" },
      "observed": { "field": "current.canonicalHeadId" }
    }
  }
}
```

`localPrecheck` is never authoritative for mutable target state. It may be used
for diagnostics or optimization, but target-owned precommit guard evaluation is
the enforcement boundary for mutable state assumptions.

## Conformance

The profile digest pins the normative fixture corpus. Third-party conformance
execution results are external attestations that reference the profile digest.
Adding a new independent test lab must not change the target profile identity.
