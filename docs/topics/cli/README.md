# CLI Topic

Status: current HEAD contract for the first public command-line surface.

This chapter describes the Edict CLI stream contract. The CLI is a compiler and
validation boundary, not an interactive pretty-printer. Every input record and
every output record is JSON Lines.

## Public Surface

The `edict` binary reads compiler requests from stdin as JSONL records. It emits
only JSONL records on stdout and stderr. Stdin is bounded before request parsing:
the default cap is 8 MiB, and `EDICT_CLI_MAX_STDIN_BYTES` may override that cap
with a positive byte count. Over-limit input is rejected with an `InputTooLarge`
CLI diagnostic and exit `2`. [CLI-REQ-001, CLI-REQ-010]

The binary takes no positional arguments. The only accepted flags are
`--help`/`-h` and `--version`/`-V`, which emit a single `edict.cli.info/v1`
record on stdout and exit `0`; the `help` record carries the usage summary, the
accepted request schema identifiers, and the exit-code contract. Any other
argument is rejected with an `InvalidArguments` diagnostic and exit `2`.
[CLI-REQ-009]

The implemented operations are `build`, `check`, and `project`.

A `build` request contains one settings record and no compiler-input records.
It selects exactly one document: `application` points to an
`edict.application/v1` manifest, while `lawpack` points to an
`edict.lawpack-build/v1` authoring document. `checkOnly` is accepted only with
`lawpack`, and either selected document path must be non-empty.

```json
{"schema":"edict.compiler.settings/v1","type":"compilerSettings","operation":"build","application":"edict.application.json"}
```

### Lawpack Builds

A lawpack build accepts application-owned typed declarations, constructs the
canonical manifest, exports, adapters, local resources, and lowercase digest
sidecars, and sends the exact bytes through the existing public lawpack,
adapter, and complete dependency-graph validators before publication:

```json
{"schema":"edict.compiler.settings/v1","type":"compilerSettings","operation":"build","lawpack":"edict.lawpack.json"}
```

All paths inside the lawpack build document are resolved relative to that
document and confined beneath its directory. The output directory is an
Edict-owned generated tree identified by `edict.lawpack-output.json`. A write
build replaces that complete tree transactionally and therefore removes stale
owned artifacts. It refuses a non-empty unowned directory or a symlinked
ownership index, and it refuses to place one owned output inside another owned
lawpack tree. Write builds acquire shared intent locks for proper ancestors and
an exclusive lock for the output itself, so disjoint sibling outputs remain
parallel while parent/child or identical output footprints conflict. After
coordination, Edict pins the publication root and output parent as capability
directories; staging, activation, rollback, and cleanup cannot follow a later
ambient-path replacement. The document directory is the publication namespace;
callers must not concurrently publish overlapping trees from different document
roots. Pure preflight derives fixed artifacts and sidecars and rejects reserved
namespaces, duplicates, ancestor collisions, filesystem NUL, nonportable names,
trailing-dot aliases, overlong paths, and case aliases before output inspection,
coordination, or dependency I/O. Raw output-directory paths use one portable
`/`-separated grammar, reserve internal names case-insensitively, and leave room
for every derived lock filename. Every dependency path component must be real;
Edict opens each one without following symbolic links and retains the accepted
file identity through overlap checks and bounded reading. A symlink therefore
cannot route an input back under the replaceable output tree. A check-only build
does not repair the owned artifact tree and
reports `LawpackOutputDrift` unless the complete existing tree is
byte-identical. It creates no directories or lock files and rechecks the
ownership basis after traversal:

```json
{"schema":"edict.compiler.settings/v1","type":"compilerSettings","operation":"build","lawpack":"edict.lawpack.json","checkOnly":true}
```

The authoring format, local-versus-external resource identity, publication
policy, and artifact ownership model are documented in the
[lawpack-authoring guide](../lawpack-authoring/README.md).

### Application Builds

An application manifest names one exact Edict source, its complete lawpack
closure, the selected target profile and provider package, and the output
directory. Both application routes accept exactly one source and a non-empty
ordered lawpack closure whose first entry is the root. They validate the
complete supplied dependency graph, reject any supplied lawpack unreachable
from that root, compile and lower the source through the root lawpack's
declarative target adapter, and resolve the selected target profile only from
its checked provider-package manifest.

The application path is resolved from the process working directory. Every
path inside the manifest is resolved from the manifest's parent directory and
must be non-empty, relative, and free of parent traversal. A minimal manifest
has this shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "edict.application/v1",
  "coordinate": "examples.hello_echo@1",
  "sources": ["src/hello_echo.edict"],
  "lawpacks": [{
    "manifest": "vendor/causal-cell/manifest.cbor",
    "exports": "vendor/causal-cell/exports.cbor",
    "adapter": "vendor/causal-cell/adapter.cbor",
    "targetConfiguration": "vendor/causal-cell/echo-operation-configuration.cbor"
  }],
  "target": {
    "profile": "echo.dpo@1",
    "providerPackage": ".build/echo-provider"
  },
  "outputDirectory": ".build/application"
}
```

`buildKind` defaults to `executableOperation`. Setting it to `externalAction`
selects the request-only route explicitly:

```json
{
  "schema": "edict.application/v1",
  "buildKind": "externalAction",
  "coordinate": "examples.workspace_observer@1",
  "sources": ["src/observe-workspace.edict"],
  "lawpacks": [{
    "manifest": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/manifest.cbor",
    "exports": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/exports.cbor",
    "adapter": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/adapter.cbor",
    "targetConfiguration": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/request-profile-configuration.cbor"
  }],
  "externalActionResources": [
    {"artifact": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/input-schema.cbor"},
    {"artifact": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/settlement-schema.cbor"},
    {"artifact": "vendor/workspace-snapshot/reconciliation-law.cbor"}
  ],
  "target": {
    "profile": "echo.dpo@1",
    "providerPackage": ".build/echo-provider"
  },
  "outputDirectory": ".build/application"
}
```

The request-only route requires at least one compiler-emitted external-action
request, rejects any callable Target IR step, and requires every request
operation digest to equal one exact root-reachable lawpack manifest digest; the
operation coordinate remains its own independently versioned resource identity.
Every input schema, settlement schema, and reconciliation law must resolve
through `externalActionResources` to one canonical
`edict.external-action-resource/v1` artifact. The build validates the resource
meta-contract and exact domain-framed identity and rejects missing, duplicate,
disconnected, substituted, opaque, non-canonical, or sentinel resources.
The list is bounded to 192 artifacts. Executable-operation builds reject a
non-empty resource list. The source budget must equal the exact obligation
declared by its selected request-only profile. `providerPackage` remains
required because the route loads and verifies its provider manifest and
selected target-profile artifact. Omitting it is `InvalidApplicationConfig`,
but no provider component is invoked. The owning canonical encoders publish:

- `core.cbor`;
- `target-ir.cbor`.

The pair is deterministic and transactionally replaces any previous
application output pair. Switching build kinds removes stale outputs from the
other route. Runtime admission, request execution, settlement, recovery, and
replay remain outside Edict. [CLI-REQ-016]

The executable-operation build invokes the provider's checked lowerer component and its structurally
separate verifier component through the capability-denied provider host. Only
an accepted verification result reaches the output directory. The current Echo
target writes the exact provider-emitted bytes as:

- `executable-operation-package.cbor`;
- `verification-report.cbor`.

Edict does not re-encode either artifact and does not execute the package.
Concurrent writers are excluded, and replacement preserves the previous pair
if either output cannot be published.

For the singleton executable-operation route, target lowering emits
compiler-authored `edict.result-projection/v1` artifacts or explicit per-intent
projection failures. The application build then requires exactly one artifact,
independently verifies it against exact Core and Target IR, and binds its
canonical bytes plus `edict.result-projection.artifact/v1` identity into both
provider semantic-input closures. Providers that implement the previous
six-input closure refuse before publication; Echo #698 owns package inclusion
and runtime consumption of the new seventh input.

Provider diagnostics are fail-closed on this first public build route: any
provider-authored diagnostic rejects publication, independent of its severity.
The terminal status `checked` count is `1` after a successful build because the
request processes one application manifest and its complete referenced closure.
[CLI-REQ-015]

A `check` request accepts:

- inline source code;
- one file path;
- one directory path;
- an ordered list of file paths;
- one glob pattern.

Each input is represented by a JSON object whose `schema` is
`edict.compiler.input/v1`. Raw source code is not a separate text mode; it is
the `source` field of a JSONL input record. [CLI-REQ-002]

A `project` request uses the same input records, including inline `source`
records for dirty editor buffers whose contents do not have to exist on disk.
It emits editor-facing projection records for requested slots:

- lexical syntax spans;
- diagnostics, always as a projection record when requested, even when empty,
  and also when a requested syntax projection cannot be produced because lexing
  fails;
- Core review JSON plus the canonical Core digest;
- Target IR review JSON plus the canonical Target IR digest.

Projection review JSON is display data for tools. The digest fields are
computed from the existing canonical Core and Target IR encoders; the projection
JSON is not a canonical hash contract. When present, review JSON exposes the
hash-significant Core and Target IR basis expressions plus the Target IR
source-Core/lawpack semantic closure, so a digest change is not paired with an
otherwise indistinguishable review payload. Compiler-level source or lowering
failures remain projection data on stdout, so editor adapters can distinguish a
bad buffer from a broken CLI transport. [CLI-REQ-013, CLI-REQ-014]

Compiler settings are represented by a JSON object whose `schema` is
`edict.compiler.settings/v1`. The request is trusted local input by default:
path, directory, path-list, and glob records read files with the caller's
filesystem privileges. Callers that accept untrusted request records can set
`inputRoot` in compiler settings; then every resolved filesystem input must stay
within that root, or the CLI rejects the request with `InputPathOutsideRoot` and
exit `2`. Inline source records are not filesystem reads. [CLI-REQ-003,
CLI-REQ-011]

Successful `check` results are emitted to stdout. A successful `build` emits
only its terminal status record to stdout after the accepted artifacts have
been written or checked. `check` compiler diagnostics, build failures, CLI input errors,
and failure status records are emitted to stderr. `project` projection records,
including compiler diagnostics and lowering failures, are emitted to stdout
when the request itself is valid. Both streams use one JSON object per line
with no banners, spinners, blank lines, or direct human prose outside JSON
string fields. [CLI-REQ-001, CLI-REQ-014, CLI-REQ-015]

When a CLI-input failure happens after the requested operation is known, the
diagnostic and terminal status records carry that command. Invalid `project`
settings therefore report `command: "project"` rather than falling back to the
`check` command. [CLI-REQ-006, CLI-REQ-007]

## Stream Contract Artifacts

Every record family on the CLI boundary has a checked-in JSON Schema. These
schemas are the stable contract for callers; the CLI does not embed a schema
validation engine. The binary rejects compiler input records with fields outside
the closed `edict.compiler.input/v1` schema variants, so callers should treat
the checked-in schemas as the accepted wire shape.

| Record `schema` | Direction | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `edict.compiler.settings/v1` | stdin | [`compiler-settings`](../../schemas/edict.compiler-settings.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-003] |
| `edict.compiler.input/v1` | stdin | [`compiler-input`](../../schemas/edict.compiler-input.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-004] |
| `edict.cli.check-result/v1` | stdout | [`cli-check-result`](../../schemas/edict.cli-check-result.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-005] |
| `edict.projection.syntax/v1` | stdout | [`projection-syntax`](../../schemas/edict.projection-syntax.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-013] |
| `edict.projection.diagnostics/v1` | stdout | [`projection-diagnostics`](../../schemas/edict.projection-diagnostics.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-013, CLI-REQ-014] |
| `edict.projection.core/v1` | stdout | [`projection-core`](../../schemas/edict.projection-core.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-013, CLI-REQ-014] |
| `edict.projection.target-ir/v1` | stdout | [`projection-target-ir`](../../schemas/edict.projection-target-ir.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-013, CLI-REQ-014] |
| `edict.cli.diagnostic/v1` | stderr | [`cli-diagnostic`](../../schemas/edict.cli-diagnostic.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-006] |
| `edict.cli.event/v1` | stdout/stderr | [`cli-event`](../../schemas/edict.cli-event.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-007] |
| `edict.cli.info/v1` | stdout | [`cli-info`](../../schemas/edict.cli-info.v1.schema.json) [CLI-REQ-009] |

## Exit Codes

- `0`: request completed successfully. Application `build` wrote accepted
  provider artifacts; lawpack write mode published its complete owned tree;
  lawpack `checkOnly` verified exact existing bytes without repairing them. For
  `project`, this can include compiler diagnostics or Target IR lowering
  failures emitted as projection records.
- `1`: compiler or validation diagnostics were produced for at least one
  source input in the `check` operation.
- `2`: CLI input or usage was invalid before compiler validation could run.

## Golden Fixtures

The CLI contract is pinned by a checked-in golden corpus under
[`fixtures/cli/`](../../../fixtures/cli/). Each case is replayed end-to-end
through the binary and its stdout, stderr, and exit code are matched
byte-for-byte. The corpus covers success, parse and semantic rejection,
CLI-input rejection, and the deterministic path, directory, path-list, and glob
expansion paths, including optional root-confinement rejection. [CLI-REQ-008]

## Deferred

The following are not implemented by this first CLI slice:

- general-purpose contract-bundle assembly;
- runtime admission and execution workflows;
- human-pretty output mode;
- Echo execution;
- language-server transport.

The verification matrix is tracked in [test-plan.md](./test-plan.md).
