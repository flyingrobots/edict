//! In-process compatibility adapters for the current built-in target lowerers.
//!
//! This module is a migration seam. It gives provider-shaped callers an
//! explicit lowerer selection and borrowed request without defining provider
//! discovery, manifest resolution, component identity, or the external WIT
//! transport ABI.
