# Hello Echo Lawpack Fixture

This is the first reviewed `edict.lawpack/v1` fixture. It exists to expose the
next real Edict-to-Echo crossing without GraphQL, native application callbacks,
a fake transport, or a handwritten Echo executable package.

- `manifest.cbor` is the canonical lawpack manifest.
- `manifest.sha256` is its `edict.lawpack/v1` domain-framed identity.
- `exports.cbor` is the canonical export surface, including authenticated
  bounded record definitions for `CreateGreetingInput` and `GreetingReceipt`.
- `exports.sha256` is its `hello.echo.exports/v1` domain-framed identity.
- `adapter.cbor` is the canonical direct declarative Echo target adapter.
- `adapter.sha256` is its manifest-bound domain-framed identity.
- `echo-operation-configuration.cbor` is the target-owned, adapter-bound
  program, budget, authority, and invocation-binding configuration that Echo
  may interpret.
- `echo-operation-configuration.sha256` is its
  `hello.echo.echo-operation-configuration/v1` domain-framed identity.
- `create-greeting.edict` imports the exact manifest digest and consumes those
  lawpack-owned input/receipt types in the bounded `createGreeting` action with
  typed `AlreadyExists` mapping.
- `create-greeting.core.cbor` is the canonical Core module compiled from that
  exact source and lawpack closure.
- `create-greeting.core.sha256` is its `edict.core.module/v1`
  domain-framed identity.
- `create-greeting.target-ir.cbor` is the canonical `echo.span-ir/v1`
  artifact lowered from that exact Core module.
- `create-greeting.target-ir.sha256` is its
  `edict.target-ir.artifact/v1` domain-framed identity.
- `create-greeting.result-projection.cbor` is the canonical
  `edict.result-projection/v1` assembly of the authored success value from
  declared application input and the capability-step result.
- `create-greeting.result-projection.sha256` is its
  `edict.result-projection.artifact/v1` domain-framed identity.

The loader validates the manifest, exports, and exact direct adapter. The
compiler derives Core and `echo.span-ir/v1` facts from that closure without a
handwritten compiler context. The golden command compiles and lowers the source
before reproducing the reviewed Core, Target IR, and result-projection bytes
and identities. This fixture does not yet bind the projected result during
Echo execution. Edict corroborates the target-configuration reference but
deliberately leaves its Echo-specific semantics and runtime evaluation to the
Echo-owned target provider.
